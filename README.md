**Transforming food accessibility. Strengthening community connections. Reducing waste.**

## 🌍 Overview

**Pass The Plate** is a decentralized, community-powered platform built to reduce food waste, fight food insecurity, and revive the human connection around food. Unlike traditional food charities that rely on centralized systems, Pass The Plate empowers everyday people, families, students, and vendors to be food heroes—sharing surplus through a smart, safe, and community-first mobile app.

Using geolocation, real-time alerts, AI-powered food listing, and cultural tagging, Pass The Plate creates an ecosystem where food finds its way to those who need it—before it goes to waste.

## ❗ The Challenge

Millions face food insecurity while perfectly good meals are discarded daily. The barriers include:

- Limited access to fresh food

- High cost of culturally familiar meals
- Isolation from neighborhood support
- Rampant waste at household and vendor levels

> In the U.S., **119 billion pounds of food are wasted annually**, while **1 in 8 Americans** goes hungry (Feeding America, 2023).

## 🚀 Why It Works

### 🔄 A Decentralized Network  
Every pantry, dorm room, or kitchen becomes a food access point—eliminating the need for trucks and warehouses.

### 💬 People Want Connection  
Sharing food builds trust and community—something that many feel is missing in today’s society.

### 🧑‍🍳 Culture on the Table  
86% of food bank recipients say they rarely receive familiar or culturally appropriate meals (Refugee Health TA Center, 2022). This platform puts that power back into their hands.

### 📈 Designed to Scale  
The more people join, the better it works—growing organically by neighborhood, not just by institution.
